# CproTeach
A program that maintains a question naire of CS questions and 
with some strong Header Files included in appendix of the book The Art and Science of C.
This is a homework required by our teacher of the course C programming. 
I heard about a checking program to judge the uniqueness of our work,
and I share my codes on the github to see what will happen.
